				<span class="title">What is the difference between Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19?</span>
				<br/>
				Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. 
				COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection 
				with influenza viruses. There are some key differences between flu and COVID-19. COVID-19 seems to spread more 
				easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms 
				and people can be contagious for longer. Another important difference is there is a vaccine to protect against flu. 
				There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed 
				to the virus. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.
				Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based 
				on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, 
				but there are some key differences between the two. While more is learned every day, there is still a lot 
				that is unknown about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it. This page compares COVID-19 and flu, 
				given the best available information to date.

				<br />
					Some children and teens who are in the hospital with the disease have an inflammatory syndrome 
					that may be linked to the new coronavirus. Doctors call it pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS). 
					Symptoms include a fever, a rash, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and heart problems. 
					It’s similar to toxic shock or to Kawasaki disease, a condition in children that causes inflammation 
					in blood vessels.

				<span class="title">How to Check for Fever</span><br />
				Your regular body temperature may be higher or lower than someone else’s. It also changes throughout the day. 
				Doctors generally consider a fever in an adult to be anything over 100.4 F on an oral thermometer and over 100.8 F 
				on a rectal thermometer.
